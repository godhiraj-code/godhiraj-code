# Hi, I'm Dhiraj Das 👋
### Automation Solutions Architect | Intelligent Quality Engineering

"Why do manual work when you can design systems that do it for you?"

I specialize in evolving traditional test automation into **Intelligent Quality Engineering**—merging Python and Local LLMs to solve the frustrations of flaky tests, bot detection, and manual overhead. With over a decade of experience in global enterprises, I build tools that don't just run scripts but understand the environment they operate in.

## 📖 The Automation Architect's Playbook (2025)
**Mastering the Internals: From Browser Fundamentals to AI-Powered Testing**
I've distilled a decade of architectural wins and battle-tested solutions into a comprehensive guide for modern automation engineers. This book explores the deep mechanics of browsers, the anatomy of flakiness, and the future of AI-driven testing.

## 🛠️ The Specialized Arsenal
I have developed a suite of niche, open-source tools to solve the "untestable" problems in modern web architecture.

### 🎯 Stability & Resilience
* **[Waitless](https://github.com/godhiraj-code/waitless)**: The ultimate flaky test eliminator. Uses mutation-based quiescence to ensure the UI is truly ready.
* **[Project Vandal](https://github.com/godhiraj-code/vandal)**: UI Mutation testing to validate the resilience and coverage of your automation suites.
* **[Selenium Teleport](https://github.com/godhiraj-code/selenium-teleport)**: Skip login screens forever by teleporting sessions across browser contexts.

### 👁️ Perception & Advanced UIs
* **[Lumos-ShadowDOM](https://github.com/godhiraj-code/lumos-shadowdom)**: Shedding light on closed Shadow Roots and nested components that traditional tools can't see.
* **[Visual-Sonar](https://github.com/godhiraj-code/visual-sonar)**: Spatial mapping for Canvas and WebGL—finding coordinates in a selector-less world.
* **[Visual-Guard](https://github.com/godhiraj-code/visual-guard)**: Visual AI regression detection to catch UI shifts that DOM assertions miss.

### 🕵️ Stealth & Infrastructure
* **[StealthAutomation](https://github.com/godhiraj-code/stealthautomation)**: Advanced bot evasion wrapper to test behind Cloudflare, Turnstile, and heavy fingerprinting.
* **[WVDAutomation](https://github.com/godhiraj-code/wvdautomation)**: Specialized infrastructure for Windows Virtual Desktop environments.

### 🤖 AI & Intelligent Testing
* **[Pytest-MockLLM](https://github.com/godhiraj-code/pytest-mockllm)**: Reliable testing for AI-driven features by mocking LLM responses during the CI/CD cycle.
* **[Selenium-Chatbot-Test](https://github.com/godhiraj-code/selenium-chatbot-test)**: Purpose-built logic for testing streaming GenAI interfaces and chatbots.

### 📊 Observability
* **[Pytest-Glow-Report](https://github.com/godhiraj-code/pytest-glow-report)**: Illuminated reporting that turns raw test data into actionable architectural insights.

### 🌌 Autonomous Orchestration
* **[CBA - Starlight Protocol](https://github.com/godhiraj-code/cba)**: The flagship "Constellation Based Automation" framework. Implements the Starlight Protocol to coordinate autonomous Sentinels for self-healing, semantic intent resolution, and resilience against UI entropy.

## 🔬 Research & Background
Co-author of the **TDCT (Triangle-Density based Clustering Technique)** technique for spatial data analysis. My background in algorithmic efficiency in spatial databases directly shapes the "Spatial Intelligence" I build into my automation tools today.
